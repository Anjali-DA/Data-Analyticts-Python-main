# 🪄Introduction to Data Analytics
## 🧿What is data analytics?
Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information.
Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

## 🧿Why Data Analytic is important?
Data analytics is important because it helps businesses optimize their performances. Implementing it into the business model means companies can help reduce costs by identifying more efficient ways of doing business and by storing large amounts of data.
A company can also use data analytics to make better business decisions and help analyze customer trends and satisfaction,which can lead to new—and better—products and services.
